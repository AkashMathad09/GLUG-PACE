    <meta name="description" content="Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. There are multiple Version Control Systems, but Git is by far and large the most popularâ€Šboth for individual and company use.">

                    <h2>Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</h2>

                    <h3>Our Pledge</h3>
                    <p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers 
                    pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, 
                    regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, 
                    level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, 
                    or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

                    <h3>Our Standards</h3>
                    <p>Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
                        <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
                        <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
                        <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
                        <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
                        <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
                        <li>Public or private harassment</li>
                        <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit 
                            permission</li>
                        <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected 
                        to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.</p>

                    <p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, 
                        wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban 
                        temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
                        offensive, or harmful.</p>

                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is 
                        representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using 
                        an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an 
                        appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined 
                        and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

                    <h3>Enforcement</h3>
                    <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the 
                        project team at <a href="mailto:glug@pace.edu.in">glug@pace.edu.in</a>. All complaints will be reviewed 
                        and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the 
                        circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an 
                        incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>

                    <p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or 
                        permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.</p>
